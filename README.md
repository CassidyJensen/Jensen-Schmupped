# Schmup's Ahoy

A shoot 'em up themed around pirates. 

The player controls a ship in the center of the screen that can move left and right using the left and right arrow keys. 
They can also shoot 3 cannonballs from either side by pressing on the up and down arrow keys. 
Enemies will spawn on either side and get stronger every 10 rounds, either by spawning more, shooting more cannonballs, or shooting more frequently. 

There are 3 pick ups available to the player:
- Ammo: Players have a limited supply of cannonballs, the ammo is a simple resupply of 10 rounds of cannonballs, use them wisely!
- Rum: A pirate's favorite drink. Players will receive double points for killing enemies while this is active. Unfortunately, it also makes it a lot harder to steer the ship. The player's speed will randomize during this state. 
- Citrus: Your best friend on the sea. It activates health regen which will bring up your health. Since the crew will be fixing the ship during this state, the player's ship can only fire one cannonball at a time now. 

This game was designed around the theme of pirates, since they are my go to favorite theme. 
I immediately gravitated to rum as a power up and decided it should be a mixed bag. This concept was further applied to an additional power up. The goal is to make players think before they instinctively grab power ups and determine whether the positive is worth risking the negative effect. 

Overall goals:
- Survival
- Power ups good and bad
- Limited ammo
- Decision Making
