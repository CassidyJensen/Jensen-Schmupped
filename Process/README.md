# 09.23.20 - Beginning Thoughts (Brainstorming)

Some initial ideas I had about this project include the following basic concepts: 

    1. Schmup as a pirate with a rum power up - you can drink rum to increase your score, but you canâ€™t shoot for a period of time after you drink. 

    2. Schmup with the elements. You have 4 different types of ammunition that can only be used against certain enemies. Enemies are immune to the same element. Opposites due more damage. 

    3. Schmup as a pirate ship. There are enemies on both sides. Cannonballs can go through and hit multiple targets. However, they need time to reload. 

    4. Schmup with karma. The longer you let the enemies live, the better/more power ups you get. Players must be careful not to get overwhelmed!

    5. Schmup with a rescue beam. There are hostages that need to be saved - but it takes time to beam them in.
