# 09.23.20 - Beginning Thoughts (Brainstorming)

Some initial ideas I had about this project include the following basic concepts: 

    1. Schmup as a pirate with a rum power up - you can drink rum to increase your score, but you can’t shoot for a period of time after you drink. 

    2. Schmup with the elements. You have 4 different types of ammunition that can only be used against certain enemies. Enemies are immune to the same element. Opposites do more damage. 

    3. Schmup as a pirate ship. There are enemies on both sides. Cannonballs can go through and hit multiple targets. However, they need time to reload. 

    4. Schmup with karma. The longer you let the enemies live, the better/more power ups you get. Players must be careful not to get overwhelmed!

    5. Schmup with a rescue beam. There are hostages that need to be saved - but it takes time to beam them in.

# 09.28.20 - Idea Refinement - Schmup’s Ahoy (#3)
1. Which of Fullerton's Formal Elements are you working with?
- Rules (Two sided weapons)
- Resources (Time or Cannonballs) 

2. What kinds of puzzles or player challenges might you include?
- Cannonballs are on a timer
- Cannonballs have a limited amount, resupply happens slowly
- Resupply based on how many enemies you can hit at once? 
- Boss enemy: The Kraken
- Requires more hits, need a supply of cannonballs ready
- No resupply during the boss
- After boss - resupply of lives? (materials for health) + Increase in difficulty?
- Players attempt to hit multiple targets with one shot. 
- Power-down - players have to shoot from both sides at once
- Have to spend time fixing the ship - but can’t shoot? 

3. What are the basic rules for your game?
- The player is a pirate ship that can move up and down on one axis
- The goal is to survive as long as possible to get a higher score
- The player can fire cannonballs on the left side or right side, depending on which button they press.
- Cannonballs can hit multiple targets.
- Cannonballs have a limited supply. Resupply occasionally drifts by (picked up by shooting it).
- Enemy ships spawns from both sides to fire at the player.
- After 3 hits, the ship is sinking and the player loses a life out of 3. 
- Or every hit brings them close to death, but they can use the fix-up materials to gain health back. However this takes time & stops cannonfire. 
- After a set amount of time, the round ends and the boss appears. 
- The kraken takes a set amount of cannonballs to defeat it. The players must dodge attacks in order to survive. Resupply may occur by hitting a difficult target during the fight? 
- After defeating the kraken, the rounds get harder by adding barriers (islands) and stronger / special enemy types. This cycle repeats. 
- If there are power-ups/power-downs they are either from special enemies hitting the player or from shooting the item in the water.
